Modern computer technology requires an understanding of both hardware and software, as the interaction between the two
 offers a framework for mastering the fundamentals of computing. The purpose of this course is to cultivate an
 understanding of modern computing technology through an in-depth study of the interface between hardware and software.
 In this course, we will study the history of modern computing technology before learning about modern computer
 architecture and a number of its important features, including instruction sets, processor arithmetic and control,
 the Von Neumann architecture, pipelining, memory management, storage, and other input/output topics. The course will
 conclude with a look at the recent switch from sequential processing to parallel processing by looking at the parallel
 computing models and their programming implications.
