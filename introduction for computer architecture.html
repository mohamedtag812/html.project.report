Computer architecture is concerned with balancing the performance, efficiency, cost, and reliability of a computer system.
 The case of instruction set architecture can be used to illustrate the balance of these competing factors.
 More complex instruction sets enable programmers to write more space efficient programs, since a single instruction
 can encode some higher-level abstraction (such as the x86 Loop instruction). However, longer and more complex
 instructions take longer for the processor to decode and can be more costly to implement effectively.
 The increased complexity from a large instruction set also creates more room for unreliability when instructions
 interact in unexpected ways.
 Computer architectures usually trade off standards, power versus performance, cost, memory capacity, latency
 (latency is the amount of time that it takes for information from one node to travel to the source) and throughput.
 Sometimes other considerations, such as features, size, weight, reliability, and expandability are also factors.
