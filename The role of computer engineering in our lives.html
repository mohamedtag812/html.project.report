Computer architecture is a science or a set of rules stating how computer software and hardware are joined together and
interact to make a computer work. It not only determines how the computer works but also of which technologies the 
computer is capable. Computers continue to be a major part of our lives, and computer architects continue to develop 
new and better programs and technologies.
Computing technology has achieved in the last two decades a tremendous advance; for example processing speed
and circuit density have increased by order of magnitude. The software field has also progressed considerably, with
new software development tools, programming languages and methodologies. This new powerful computing
environment is packaged and made available to individual users in the form of 'Personal Computers', and to
engineers or designers in the form of the new generation of 'Graphical Workstations'. During the same period,
continuous research and development in the computer aided design field, has enabled to harness this computer
power, and provide designers with new tools. Computer based design tools offer significant advantages over
traditional design practice. In fact, they allow performing design operations in ways that have never been possible
