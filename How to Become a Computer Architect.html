To become a computer architect, often called computer network architect, the candidate must have at least a bachelor’s
 degree in computer science, engineering, information systems or a related field. The best programs for aspiring computer
 architects are computer-based fields because they offer students the most hands-on experience in database design or
 network security, both of which are important for computer architects. These classes also teach the students various
 technologies used in different networks.Some students choose to complete an MBA (master’s of business administration) with a focus on information systems. 
The advantage of this program is that it offers both computer-related and business courses. Even after earning the degree
applicants may be required to have at least five years of experience working with IT systems before being hired as a
computer architect. Some computer architects go on to become computer and information systems managers once they’ve 
obtained sufficient experience.
